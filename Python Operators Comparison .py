 # Python Comparison Operators
a = 12
b = 23

# (==) Equal Operator
print(a == b)     # returns False because 12 is not equal to 23
print(23 == b)    # returns true because 23is is equal to 23

# (!=) Not equal Operator
print(a != b)      # returns true because 12 is not equal to 23
print(23 != b)    # returns false because 23 is is equal to 23

# (>) Greater than Operator
print(a > b)      # returns false because 12 is not greater than 23
print(24 > b)    # returns true because 24 is is greater than 23

# (<) Less than Operator
print(a < b)      # returns true because 12 is less than 23
print(24 < b)    # returns false because 24 is not less than 23

# (>=) Greater than or equal  Operator
print(a >= b)      # returns false because 12 is not greater, or equal, to 23
print(24 >= b)    # returns True because 24 is greater, or equal, to 23

# (<=) Less than or equal to  Operator
print(a <= b)      # returns true because 12 is Less, or equal, to 23
print(24 <= b)    # returns False because 24 is neither less than or equal to 23
